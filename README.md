# Crowdfunding_ETL
In this project, we created an ETL pipeline using python, pandas, and python dictionary methods to extract and tranform data. After transforming the data, we created four csv files and used them to create an ERD and a table schema. This data was then uploaded to postgres.

The code used for extraction and transformation can be found in the ETL_Mini_project_LAtchley_ADelgado_MJohnson file in the Starter_files folder. The starting data and csvs can be found in the Resources folder located in the Starter_files folder. The ERD can be found in the QuickDBD file located in the Starter_file folder. The sql table schema can be found in the crowdfunding_db_schema.sql file.
